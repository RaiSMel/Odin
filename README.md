> The Project Library was made focusing in practice the Object Constructors, the main gol of the project is to add the books that you already read or want to read and you can edit the book if you have written something wrong.

### Adjusts and improvements

The project has been completed:

- [x] create the book Objects
- [x] All of your book objects are going to be stored in an array
- [x] Write a function that loops through the array and displays each book on the page.
- [x] Add a “NEW BOOK” button that brings up a form allowing users to input the details for the new book: author, title, number of pages and whether it’s been read.
- [x] Add a button on each book’s display to remove the book from the library.

> The Project Tic Tac Toe has been made to play with your friends or you can play with a cpu that randomize a move. I hope that you guys have fun playing it.

### Adjusts and improvements

The project has been completed:

- [x] You’re going to store the gameboard as an array inside of a Gameboard object
- [x] Focus on getting a working game in the console first.
- [x] Once you have a working console game, create an object that will handle the display/DOM logic.
- [x] Write the functions that allow players to add marks to a specific spot on the board by interacting with the appropriate DOM elements (e.g. letting players click on a board square to place their marker).
